# Demonstration of the program code

the program has 3 main classes (hospital, person and appointment)
and 2 subclasses (doctor and patient) that inherit from the person class

**Hospital class** has the main menu that user can choose the desired service from by numbers 1-9
and general lists (patients, doctors, appointments) that are used alongside the classes.

**Person Class** has some features inherited to the doctor and patient like name and age..

**Doctor and Patient Classes** are likely the sameÙˆ they have 3 methods (register, view, search)

**Appointment Class** is likely the same as the 2 subclasses.
you can add an appointment and view all appointments.

Run the program and follow the instructions to handle your system data.
